# Crash-Code-of-FastAPI

FastAPI Crash Course – Backend API Development 🚀

This repository contains my hands-on practice and implementation of core FastAPI concepts. 
The goal of this project was to understand modern, high-performance backend development using Python.

Technologies Used:
- Python
- FastAPI
- Uvicorn
- Pydantic
- Virtual Environment (venv)

Features Implemented:
- RESTful API endpoints (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Path parameters and query parameters
- Request body validation using Pydantic
- Automatic API documentation (/docs)
- JSON response handling
- Basic backend structure setup

This project serves as a foundation for building scalable APIs and deploying AI/ML models in the future.
